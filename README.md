# üöÄ WYSIWYG Reports: Identical PDF, XLSX & Print Preview Output from a Single C# Codebase (Built from Scratch!)

Tired of your PDF, XLSX exports looking different from your print previews? Sick of wrestling with complex libraries just to generate a simple report? This project is the solution.

This is a C# WinForms application that demonstrates how to generate reports with a **guaranteed identical appearance** across üñºÔ∏è **WinForms PrintPreview**, üìÑ **Adobe Acrobat PDF**, and üìä **Microsoft Office Excel XLSX** outputs. What you see is *truly* what you get.

The entire rendering pipeline is **built from scratch with zero third-party libraries**. This project serves as a powerful example of how to take full control over your document generation process.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **True WYSIWYG:** The layout, fonts, and positioning are pixel-perfect and identical across all three output formats.
*   **Zero Dependencies:** No Nuget packages, no external libraries. Just pure .NET Framework code. The PDF and XLSX writers are built from the ground up.
*   **Unified Codebase:** A single drawing logic (`DrawContent`) defines the report's appearance. No need to write separate code for PDF, Excel, and printing!
*   **Shared Page Setup:** Page settings (margins, orientation, paper size) from a single `PageSetupDialog` are respected by all export formats.
*   **PDF/A-1a Compliant PDF:** The generated PDF is a valid PDF/A-1a file, suitable for long-term archiving. It achieves this by manually building the document structure, embedding fonts, and including required metadata.
*   **Native XLSX Output:** The generated Excel file is a native Office Open XML (`.xlsx`) document, so it opens without "Compatibility Mode" warnings.

## ü§î How It Works: The "Capture & Replay" Method

Instead of using different logic for each format, this project uses a unified rendering pipeline built around an intermediate representation.

1.  **‚öôÔ∏è Capture Phase:** A custom `GraphicsRecorder` class intercepts all GDI+ drawing commands (`DrawString`, `DrawRectangle`, etc.) and stores them as a simple list of string commands. This list acts as a "blueprint" for the report.

    ```csharp
    // Instead of drawing directly to a Graphics object...
    // e.Graphics.DrawString("Hello", ...);

    // We record the command:
    graphicsRecorder.DrawString("Hello", ...);
    // Command is stored as: "DrawString|Hello|Arial|9|Bold|100|150|1"
    ```

2.  **üé® Replay Phase:** This "blueprint" is then passed to different renderers, each translating the commands into a specific format:
    *   **Print Preview:** Replays the commands onto the `PrintPageEventArgs.Graphics` object for a live on-screen preview.
    *   **PDF Exporter:** Parses the command list and manually constructs a PDF document from scratch. It builds all the necessary PDF objects (`/Catalog`, `/Pages`, `/Font`), embeds font data (fetched using P/Invoke calls to `gdi32.dll`), and writes the file stream byte-by-byte.
    *   **XLSX Exporter:** Also parses the command list. It creates a `.zip` archive and generates the required XML files (`workbook.xml`, `sheet.xml`, etc.) to build a valid `.xlsx` file. It meticulously translates command coordinates into Excel row heights, column widths, and cell positions to replicate the original layout.

## ‚úÖ Feature Support

This implementation focuses on the core features needed for simple, structured reports. It is intentionally kept simple and does not support all possible GDI+, XLSX or PDF/A features.

## üí° Why This Approach? (vs. 3rd Party Libraries)

While powerful open-source libraries like `iTextSharp`, `PdfSharp`, and `EPPlus` are fantastic, they can sometimes be:
*   **Complex:** They have a steep learning curve with a vast API.
*   **"Black Boxes":** It can be hard to understand or debug what's happening under the hood.
*   **Overkill:** For simple, precise reports, they can be more than you need.

This project offers a **lightweight, transparent, and educational alternative**. It's perfect for:
*   Learning how file formats like PDF and XLSX are structured.
*   Projects where you need absolute control over the output.
*   Situations where you want to avoid adding external dependencies.

## üöÄ Future Roadmap & Potential Improvements

This project provides a solid foundation, but there are many exciting ways it can be extended. Here are some of the planned and potential features for the future:

#### üé® Core Drawing Features
*   **Implement Image Support:** Add a `DrawImage` command to the `GraphicsRecorder` and implement the logic to embed image data (JPEG, PNG) into both PDF and XLSX files while maintaining the WYSIWYG principle.
*   **Support for Additional Shapes:** Extend the system to handle other GDI+ primitives like `DrawEllipse`, `DrawArc`, and `DrawPolygon` for more complex diagrams and charts.
*   **Improve Text Handling:** Add support for more advanced text rendering, such as text alignment (center/right), rotated text, and styles like underline/strikethrough.

#### ‚ö° Performance & Optimization
*   **Introduce Font Subsetting:** A high-priority task. Currently, the entire font file is embedded in the PDF, leading to larger file sizes. Implementing font subsetting (embedding only the characters actually used) will drastically reduce the PDF size while maintaining compliance.
*   **Background Processing:** For large reports, the export process can freeze the UI. Refactor the export logic to run on a background thread (`async/await`) with progress updates to keep the application responsive.

#### üèóÔ∏è Code Architecture & Quality
*   **Modularize the Code:** Refactor the core `GraphicsRecorder`, PDF writer, and XLSX writer into a separate, reusable class library. This would allow other projects to easily consume this functionality.
*   **Expand Unit Tests:** Create a comprehensive test suite that verifies the output for a given set of intermediate commands, ensuring that bug fixes or new features don't cause regressions.

Contributions are welcome! If any of these features interest you, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
