# Getting Support

Thank you for using the **C# Unified Rendering: Identical PDF, XLSX & WinForms PrintPreview from Scratch** project! We want to make sure you have a great experience. This document outlines the best ways to get help.

## How to Get Help

The primary way to get support is through our GitHub repository. We ask that you **do not** email the author directly for support questions. Keeping support requests in the public channels helps the entire community.

Here are the recommended channels:

*   **❓ Ask a Question:** If you have a general question about how to use the tool, an idea for a feature, or want to show something you've built, please use [**GitHub Discussions**](../../discussions). This is the best place for "how-to" questions and open-ended conversations.

*   **🐛 Report a Bug:** If you've found a bug, a crash, or other unexpected behavior, please open an [**Issue on GitHub**](../../issues). Please see the "Reporting a Bug" section below for details on what to include.

*   **✨ Request a Feature:** If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing one, please also open an [**Issue on GitHub**](../../issues).

## Reporting a Bug

A great bug report is a huge help! Before submitting, please **search the existing issues** to see if your problem has already been reported.

When you open a new issue to report a bug, please include the following information:

1.  **A Clear and Descriptive Title:** For example, "Crash when exporting to XLSX with custom paper size" instead of "It's broken".
2.  **Steps to Reproduce:** Provide a clear, step-by-step list of actions that will reliably cause the bug.
    *   Example:
        1.  Launch the application.
        2.  Go to 'File' -> 'Page Setup'.
        3.  Set the paper size to A3 and orientation to Landscape.
        4.  Click the 'Convert to XLSX' button.
        5.  The application crashes.
3.  **Expected Behavior:** What did you expect to happen?
    *   Example: "I expected an XLSX file to be generated and saved successfully."
4.  **Actual Behavior:** What happened instead? Please include:
    *   A description of the problem.
    *   Any error messages you saw (copy and paste the full text).
    *   Screenshots or GIFs are extremely helpful!
5.  **Your Environment:**
    *   **Operating System:** (e.g., Windows 11, Windows 10 Version 22H2)
    *   **.NET Framework Version:** (If you know it)
    *   **Printer/Printer Driver:** (If the issue is related to printing or page setup)
